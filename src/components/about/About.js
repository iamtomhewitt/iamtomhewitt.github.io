			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr />
			<p />
			<p>
				I'm currently a software developer at William Hill, working on the software for self service betting terminals. I play drums, a few video games (as well as make my own on Google Play!). And I love a bit of metal.
				<br />
				<br />
				I graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a First Class Honours in Computer Science (Games Technology)
				<br />
				<br />
				My final year project involved creating a virtual reality interactive model of the human heart to assess its usefulness as an alternative learning style for medical students (as compared to 2D diagrams and textbooks).
