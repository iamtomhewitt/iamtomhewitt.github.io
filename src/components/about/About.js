    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm currently a software developer at William Hill, working on the software for self service betting terminals. </p>
    <p>I play drums, a few video games (as well as make my own on Google Play!).</p>
    <p>And I love a bit of metal.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a First Class Honours in Computer Science (Games Technology)</p>
    <p>
      My final year project involved creating a virtual reality interactive model of the human heart to assess its usefulness
      as an alternative learning style for medical students (as compared to 2D diagrams and textbooks).
